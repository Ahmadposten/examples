In order to install the Instana agent, go to the Universe listing in the DC/OS web UI, and **click on "Install"** on the Instana agent list item. Since you need to provide custom informations, **click "Advanced Installation"**. The only required action here is to **fill in your Instana agent key**.

If you're a SaaS customer, that is reporting to the US environment, the rest of the values can be left with the default values. EU - SaaS customers should **switch to the "saas-eu-west-1.Instana.io" endpoint**. If you're an on-premises customer, please **enter your backend machine's host address** and **set the port to 1444**.

Also, you can assign host tags here.

## Scaling the Instana agent

This is being taken care of by the deployment constraints. If you have, say, three hosts, and set the scaling to three, DC/OS will deploy exactly one isntana agent on each host. If you want different host tags for each and every machine, the isntana agent needs to be deployed separately.
